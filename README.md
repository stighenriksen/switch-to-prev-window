# switch-to-prev-window 

Small wrapper for invoking xdotools and wmctrl to enable switching
between the two last previously used windows.

You probably don't need this unless you're writing your own window
manager as an exercise or something. Most window managers should have
this built-in ('switch windows directly' or similar).
